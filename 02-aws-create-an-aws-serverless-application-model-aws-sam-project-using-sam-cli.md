# Create an AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) project using SAM CLI

## [Video link](https://egghead.io/lessons/aws-create-an-aws-serverless-application-model-aws-sam-project-using-sam-cli?pl=learn-aws-serverless-application-model-aws-sam-framework-from-scratch-baf9)

- Follow the instructions to install the SAM CLI tool (link down below)

- Tomasz then steps through using it to set-up a project

- The CLI produces a skeleton boilerplate for a hello-world function and the infrastructure needed to build this.

- Manually this would take 10-15 minutes of clicking around

## Resources

In order to install the SAM CLI on your OS, follow the official AWS guide: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)

## Personal take

Such a big time saver! I'm hoping the build and deploy steps are as straightforward and helpful.

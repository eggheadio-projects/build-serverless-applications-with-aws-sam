## Description

Building larger serverless applications can be tricky - creating many lambda functions as well as other resources such as DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, API Gateways using AWS Console takes quite a lot of time. Not to mention other problems such as redeploying the app to a different region, reviewing the infrastructure etc.

AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM for short) simplifies a lot of those issues 🤩

Built with with best practices in mind, SAM allows you to:

🌟define your infrastructure as code using a YAML template (which can go through code review!)

🌟define resources such as lambda functions, DynamoDB tables etc. in a much simpler way than doing it directly in CloudFormation (which SAM is built on top of)

🌟build and deploy a serverless application from a command line

🌟debug and test lambda functions locally using SAM CLI

🌟debug and test lambda functions from WITHIN your editor with AWS Toolkit extension

Add AWS SAM to your toolkit with this quick collection!

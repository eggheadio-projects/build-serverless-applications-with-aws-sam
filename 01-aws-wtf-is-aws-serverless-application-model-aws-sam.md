## [Video link](https://egghead.io/lessons/aws-wtf-is-aws-serverless-application-model-aws-sam?pl=learn-aws-serverless-application-model-aws-sam-framework-from-scratch-baf9)

- The aim of SAM is to allow developers to build products using the AWS infrastructure with only a few lines of code.

- It is built on top of AWS CloudFormation but is much less verbose.

- You describe your infrastructure as code in YAML and this allows you to spin up services in a much more straightforward way than through Cloudformation

- The `sam` CLI is really powerful. It allows to you to build, deploy and locally invoke your functions. Amazingly helpful in development.

- Tomasz recommends installing the AWS Toolkit in your code editor of choice.

- Among other things, this allows your to debug your functions locally.

## Personal take

I've built infrastructure with Terraform and used the serverless framework to build and deploy lambda functions. I haven't used SAM before but this looks really good - I'm excited :)
